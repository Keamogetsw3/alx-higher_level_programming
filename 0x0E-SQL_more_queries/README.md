# 0x0E. SQL - More Queries

## Description
This project focuses on advanced SQL concepts, including creating and managing users, granting permissions, constraints, subqueries, and working with multiple tables. By the end of this project, you should be able to explain and apply these concepts effectively.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you should understand:

- How to create a new MySQL user.
- How to manage privileges for a user to a database or table.
- What a PRIMARY KEY is and its importance.
- What a FOREIGN KEY is and how it enforces relationships between tables.
- How to use NOT NULL and UNIQUE constraints.
- How to retrieve data from multiple tables in a single request.
- The purpose and usage of subqueries.
- The difference between JOIN and UNION and their respective use cases.
