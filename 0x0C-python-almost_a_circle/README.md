# 0x0C. Python - Almost a circle

## Description

This project is part of the Higher Level Programming curriculum at Holberton School and is designed to prepare you for the AirBnB project. In this project, you will review various aspects of Python, including:

- Import
- Exceptions
- Class
- Private attribute
- Getter/Setter
- Class method
- Static method
- Inheritance
- Unittest
- Read/Write file

Additionally, you will learn about:

- args and kwargs
- Serialization/Deserialization
- JSON

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following topics without needing to use external resources:

### General

- What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project
- How to serialize and deserialize a Class
- How to write and read a JSON file
- What is *args and how to use it
- What is **kwargs and how to use it
- How to handle named arguments in a function


## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
- All your modules should be documented: `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`
- All your classes should be documented: `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should be documented: `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`
- Documentation should be descriptive and provide a clear explanation of the purpose of the module, class, or method (the length of it will be verified)

### Python Unit Tests

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files should end with a new line
- All your test files should be inside a folder `tests`
- You have to use the `unittest` module
- All your test files should be python files (extension: `.py`)
- All your test files and folders should start with `test_`
- Your file organization in the `tests` folder should mirror your project structure (e.g., for `models/base.py`, unit tests must be in `tests/test_models/test_base.py`)
- All your tests should be executed using the command: `python3 -m unittest discover tests`
- You can also run tests file by file using this command: `python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base.py`
- Collaboration on test cases is encouraged to ensure edge cases are covered.
