# 0x0C. Python - Almost a Circle

## Project Overview

This project serves as a review of key Python concepts and object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in preparation for the AirBnB project. You will work with classes, serialization, deserialization, file handling, and unit testing.

## Background Context

This project will reinforce your understanding of:

- Importing modules
- Handling exceptions
- Classes and object-oriented programming
- Private attributes
- Getters and setters
- Class methods and static methods
- Inheritance
- Unit testing
- Reading and writing files

Additionally, you will learn about:

- `*args` and `**kwargs`
- Serialization and deserialization
- JSON format and handling

## Resources

You should read or watch the following resources:

- [args/kwargs](https://realpython.com/python-kwargs-and-args/)
- [JSON encoder and decoder](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html)
- [unittest module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)
- [Python test cheatsheet](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/tests/)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

### General

- What unit testing is and how to implement it in a large project
- How to serialize and deserialize a class
- How to write and read a JSON file
- What `*args` is and how to use it
- What `**kwargs` is and how to use it
- How to handle named arguments in a function

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using **Python 3.8.5**
- All files should end with a **new line**
- The first line of all files must be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file is **mandatory**
- Code must comply with `pycodestyle` (version **2.8.**)
- All files must be executable
- File length will be tested using `wc`
- All modules should be documented:  
  ```bash
  python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'
