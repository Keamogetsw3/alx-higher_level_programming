## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without relying on Google:

### General
- Why Python programming is awesome
- What is a superclass, baseclass, or parentclass
- What is a subclass
- How to list all attributes and methods of a class or instance
- When can an instance have new attributes
- How to inherit a class from another
- How to define a class with multiple base classes
- What is the default class every class inherits from
- How to override a method or attribute inherited from the base class
- Which attributes or methods are available by heritage to subclasses
- What is the purpose of inheritance
- What, when, and how to use isinstance, issubclass, type, and super built-in functions

### Copyright - Plagiarism
- Solutions must be original; copying or plagiarism is prohibited.

## Requirements

### Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- Files end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Mandatory README.md file at the root
- Code should use pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- All files must be executable
- File lengths tested using `wc`

### Python Test Cases
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All test files in a `tests` folder
- Test files are text files (extension: .txt)
- Tests executed using `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
- Modules, classes, and functions documented
- Documentation should provide clear explanations

## Documentation

- Avoid using the words "import" or "from" in comments
- Documentation should be meaningful sentences explaining the purpose of modules, classes, or methods
